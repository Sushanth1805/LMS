# LMS (Learning Management System)

## Overview
Welcome to the Learning Management System (LMS) README! This document provides essential information for developers and users about the LMS application.

## Introduction
The LMS is a web-based application designed to facilitate the management and delivery of educational courses and training programs. It allows instructors to create and manage courses, organize learning materials, assess student progress, and facilitate communication between instructors and students.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication system for both instructors and students.
- **Course Management**: Instructors can create, edit, and delete courses. They can also add learning materials such as lectures, quizzes, assignments, and resources.
- **Enrollment**: Students can enroll in courses offered by instructors.
- **Learning Material**: Support for various types of learning materials including text, videos, documents, and external links.
- **Communication**: Messaging system for communication between instructors and students, as well as among students.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js

  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (or other database management system)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the LMS repository from GitHub to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up environment variables for your development environment. You may need to create a `.env` file in the backend directory to store sensitive information such as database connection strings and API keys.
